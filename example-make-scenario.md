## Example Adsroid Response

```
=== CROSS-PLATFORM PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ===
Week of January 29 - February 4, 2024

GOOGLE ADS
- Spend: $3,420
- Conversions: 87
- Average CPA: $39.31
- ROAS: 4.2x

META ADS
- Spend: $2,180
- Conversions: 103
- Average CPA: $21.17
- ROAS: 7.1x

LINKEDIN ADS
- Spend: $1,450
- Conversions: 19
- Average CPA: $76.32
- ROAS: 2.8x

=== PLATFORM COMPARISON ===

Best ROAS: Meta Ads (7.1x) - significantly ahead
Best CPA: Meta Ads ($21.17) - 46% better than Google, 72% better than LinkedIn

Performance gap analysis:
- Meta Ads consistently outperforming other platforms
- LinkedIn has highest CPA, likely due to B2B targeting premium
- Google Ads performance solid but not exceptional

BUDGET REALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION:
Consider shifting $500/week from LinkedIn to Meta Ads:
- LinkedIn showing weak ROAS (2.8x vs. 4.2x+ on other platforms)
- Meta demonstrating consistent efficiency
- Estimated impact: +23 conversions/week at current Meta CPA

=== TOP 3 ACTION ITEMS THIS WEEK ===

1. [HIGH PRIORITY] Test budget reallocation
   - Move $500 from LinkedIn to Meta
   - Monitor for 14 days before making permanent
   - Expected: Improved overall ROAS from 4.7x to 5.1x

2. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Investigate Meta Ads success factors
   - Analyze winning campaigns/audiences
   - Apply learnings to Google Ads
   - Could improve Google CPA by 15-20%

3. [INVESTIGATE] LinkedIn Ads optimization
   - High CPA may be acceptable if lead quality is superior
   - Review conversion-to-customer rate
   - If LTV supports current CPA, maintain; otherwise reduce spend
```

## Advanced Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Add Data Visualization

After Google Sheets module, add:

1. Google Sheets: "Get a Cell"
   - Extract key metrics from analysis text
2. Google Sheets: "Update a Cell"
   - Update summary cells for dashboard
3. Optional: Trigger Google Data Studio refresh

### Enhancement 2: Create Tasks from Recommendations

Add third router path:

1. Search for "Asana" or "Trello"
2. Select "Create a Task"
3. Parse action items from Adsroid response
4. Create separate tasks for each priority

**Text parser example:**
- Pattern: `\d+\. \[.*?\] (.+?)\n`
- This extracts: "Test budget reallocation", "Investigate Meta Ads success factors", etc.

### Enhancement 3: Conditional Budget Alerts

Add filter to Slack path:

1. Filter: `{{contains(adsroid.message; "reallocation")}}`
2. Route to different Slack channel: `#finance`
3. Tag relevant people: `@finance-team`

### Enhancement 4: Weekly Email Report

Add email path to router:

1. Search for "Email"
2. Select "Send an Email"
3. Configure:
   - To: `team@company.com`
   - Subject: `Weekly Marketing Performance - Week {{formatDate(now; "w")}}`
   - Body: `{{adsroid.message}}`
   - Attachments: Optional screenshot from Sheets

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Adsroid Module Not Found

**Solution:** 
1. Verify you accepted the invitation
2. Refresh Make interface
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try searching "Adsroid" (no spaces)

### Issue: API Key Invalid

**Solution:**
1. Go to Adsroid Settings → API Key
2. Regenerate key if needed
3. Copy new key
4. Update Make connection

### Issue: Timeout Errors

**Solution:**
1. Increase timeout in advanced settings to 30 seconds
2. Simplify Adsroid query (analyze fewer platforms or shorter timeframe)
3. Add retry logic via error handler

### Issue: Response Too Long for Slack

**Solution:**
Add this to Adsroid query:
```
Provide concise summary under 500 words suitable for Slack.
```

Or truncate in Slack module:
```
{{substring(adsroid.message; 0; 1000)}}...
```

## Cost Analysis

**Make operations consumed:**
- 1 Schedule trigger
- 1 Adsroid API call
- 1 Slack message
- 1 Google Sheets row
- Total: ~4 operations per run

**Monthly cost:**
- 4 operations × 4 weeks = 16 operations/month
- Well within Make's free tier (1,000 operations/month)

**Adsroid credits:**
- 1 API call per week = 4 calls/month
- Each call consumes 5-7 credits (cross-platform analysis)
- Total: ~30 credits/month

## Benefits

**Time savings:**
- Manual cross-platform analysis: 90 minutes/week
- Automated: 5 minutes/week to review
- Savings: 85 minutes × 4 weeks = 340 minutes/month (~6 hours)

**Consistency:**
- Never miss a weekly review
- Standardized analysis format
- Historical data automatically logged

**Team alignment:**
- Everyone sees same analysis in Slack
- Transparent recommendations
- Easy to discuss and implement

## Next Steps

1. Run scenario manually a few times to verify output quality
2. Refine Adsroid query based on team feedback
3. Add additional router paths as needed (email, tasks, etc.)
4. Consider creating similar scenarios for:
   - Daily budget alerts
   - Monthly executive summaries
   - Campaign launch monitoring
